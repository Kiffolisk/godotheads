The Blockheads server recreation written in GDScript

# What?
This is a The Blockheads server written in GDScript entirely and made in the Godot engine. It has GUI that will have the same features as the official Mac version of the server app.

# Why?
A Blockheads server is currently impossible to self host without a Mac or Mac VM, this is made as an example for The Blockheads server recreations.

This uses Godot because a lot of networking features The Blockheads uses are already built into base Godot.

# Is this finished?
It will never be completely finished. Any additional feature is accepted and exact porting from the Mac app to Godot is close to impossible.
